# Automatic Fish Feeder with ESP32

This project was initiated for the End-term exam of the Internet of Things lecture at Universitas Internasional Batam. It involves building an automated fish feeder using the ESP32 microcontroller, Blynk ecosystem, a servo motor, and an ultrasonic sensor for remote control and feeding schedule management.

## Features
- Automates fish feeding schedules
- Remote control via the Blynk app
- Feeding level percentage calculation using an ultrasonic sensor
- Visualization of feeding times with a graph
